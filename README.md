# Verbose Code Reading

I read open source code and log everything that comes to my mind.  It's not strictly about reading, because I might try building the code, running tests and so on.

For each codebase, I keep
* a verbose append-only log of my reading activity, and
* a queue of leftovers.
I allow myself to fix grammars and typos in the append-only log.

I read papers too, but probably only those with open source implementations.

## What to Read

* GRIN
* HOLZero
* K-Framework
* K verification of DAI
* ocamlc
* Z3
* Research papers that cite mine
