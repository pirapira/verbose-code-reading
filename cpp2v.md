* read Coq.Program.Basics https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Program.Basics.html#
* saw https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Program.Tactics.html# lots of lots of tactics
    * for now, understanding the statements are more important
* read https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Relations.Relation_Definitions.html#
* read https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Classes.Init.html#
    * I don't understand class_apply
    * I don't understand the unconvertible tactic either
* read https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Classes.RelationClasses.html#
    * 'morphism search' sounds like coercion or something
* what was Program Instance
    * Instance in Program mode
* what is this back-quote thinigy `(Reflexive A R) --- constraint, unnamed.
    * https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/type-classes.html
* saw Coq.Morphisms https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Classes.Morphisms.html
    * relation of relation to itself...
* read Coq.Program.Syntax
* saw base https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp/-/blob/master/theories/base.v
    * tweaking program, educational
    * what does this do? Arguments unseal {_ _} _ : assert.
    * I don't understand Non-backtracking type classes. There is clearly chaos around here.
      I appreciate S's work more.
    * I sense something like Prolog.
    * Why is this talking about backtracking always?
    * So many things are presented again as classes.
* saw proof_irrel
    * what is this saying `x = `y

## TODO

* read decidable
* read option
* read numbers
* read list
* read countable
* read stdpp.gmap.
* read avl.v
* find somewhere to start
